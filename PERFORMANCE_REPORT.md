## 🧭 Clustering Flags

### `-g` Auto-Group (Default)

Automatically determines the optimal number of clusters based on file content similarity.

### `-n <int>` Manual Cluster Count

Overrides `-g` by allowing manual specification of the number of clusters.

## 🗃️ Clustering Modes Overview

| Mode No. | Mode Name           | Description                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | **Semantic**         | Uses embeddings for file content and clusters files by semantic similarity. |
| 2        | **Directory-Based**  | Groups files based on their directory structure.                            |
| 3        | **Pattern-Based**    | Groups files using file naming patterns and extensions.                     |

## ⚡ Gemini Workers: Parallel API Execution

To enhance scalability and reduce execution time, **Gitcury** introduces **Gemini Workers** — parallel processing units that distribute clustering tasks across multiple Gemini API keys. This parallelism allows the system to handle large commit sets faster and more efficiently.

### 🚀 How It Works

When multiple Gemini API keys are provided, Gitcury assigns each API key as a worker thread. Tasks such as file embedding or commit segmentation are then distributed across these threads, enabling true parallel execution.

> ✅ **More API keys = More parallelism = Faster execution**

This is especially impactful for large repositories or first-time commits where multiple embedding operations would otherwise be executed sequentially.

---

### 🛠️ Configuration

To enable Gemini Workers, you simply add multiple API keys in your Gitcury configuration under `GEMINI_API`. Keys must be comma-separated **without spaces**:

```bash
gitcury config set --key GEMINI_API_KEY --value YOUR_API_KEY_ONE,YOUR_API_KEY_TWO,YOUR_API_KEY_THREE
```

Once configured, Gitcury will automatically manage parallel requests based on the number of API keys provided.

> 🔒 **Security Note**: All API keys are stored securely in your local Gitcury configuration.

---

### 🧪 Example

**Scenario:**

- You have **3 Gemini API keys** configured.
- Gitcury receives a **semantic clustering** request for **90 files**.
- Each **Gemini Worker** handles ~30 files concurrently.

**Result:**  
Execution time is reduced by approximately **60–70%**, depending on system resources and network latency.

---

> 📌 **Best Practice**: For optimal performance without exceeding API rate limits, configure **2–4 Gemini API keys**.

---

## 🛑 Historical Baseline

The original semantic-only approach lacked optimization features like caching, error recovery, and clustering. As a result:

- **Time to Process 51 Files**: ~5 minutes  
- **Clusters Formed**: 5  
- **Major Bottlenecks**: No caching, full linear execution, excessive API calls  

All current methods now outperform this baseline both in speed and resource usage.

## 🖋️ Maintainer Note

> Gitcury has evolved from a naïve linear semantic model into a robust, clustered, and distributed system. With support for **Gemini Workers** and **multiple clustering modes**, Gitcury can now process enterprise-grade repositories with high performance and minimal cost.  
>  
> Default strategy is now `directory` mode with auto-grouping. Semantic mode is preserved for quality-sensitive use cases.

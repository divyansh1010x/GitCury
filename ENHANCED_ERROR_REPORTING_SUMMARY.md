# Enhanced Error Reporting System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully enhanced GitCury's error reporting system to display the file that caused the error, making it easier to identify which files are causing issues during operations like commit message generation, file staging, and Git commands.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Logger (`utils/logger.go`)
- ✅ Modified `Error()` function to accept optional file parameter
- ✅ Added file context formatting in error messages with `[File: filename]` format
- ✅ Preserved existing error formatting while adding file information

### 2. Enhanced Structured Errors (`utils/errors.go`)
- ✅ Added `ProcessedFile` field to `StructuredError` struct
- ✅ Updated all error creation helper functions:
  - `NewGitError()` - includes file context
  - `NewValidationError()` - includes file context
  - `NewAPIError()` - includes file context
- ✅ Enhanced `Error()` method to include file information in error strings

### 3. Enhanced Git Package (`git/git.go`)
- ✅ Updated `RunGitCmdWithTimeout()` to include directory/file information in errors
- ✅ Enhanced `GetAllChangedFiles()` with file-specific error reporting
- ✅ Improved `GenCommitMessage()` to include file information in API call errors
- ✅ Enhanced `BatchProcessGetMessages()` with file context in error handling
- ✅ Updated `CommitBatch()` with comprehensive file-aware error reporting
- ✅ Improved `PushBranch()` to include folder/file context in errors
- ✅ Enhanced `BatchProcessWithEmbeddings()` with file information

### 4. Enhanced Core Package
#### Core Commit (`core/commit.go`)
- ✅ Updated `CommitAllRoots()` to extract and propagate file information from errors
- ✅ Enhanced `CommitOneRoot()` to include file context in error handling
- ✅ Added structured error creation instead of simple `fmt.Errorf()`

#### Core Messages (`core/msgs.go`)
- ✅ Enhanced `GetAllMsgs()` with file-aware error handling
- ✅ Updated `GetMsgsForRootFolder()` to include file context
- ✅ Improved error aggregation to show affected files
- ✅ Added validation errors with file information

#### Core Push (`core/push.go`)
- ✅ Enhanced `PushAllRoots()` with file-aware error reporting
- ✅ Updated `PushOneRoot()` to extract and include file information
- ✅ Added structured error creation with file context

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Created `tests/utils/file_error_test.go` with comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Added tests for all error types with file context
- ✅ Created `utils/string_utils.go` helper for testing
- ✅ Verified all tests pass successfully

## Key Features

### File Context in Error Messages
```go
// Before
utils.Error("[GIT.COMMIT.FAIL]: Failed to add file")

// After  
utils.Error("[GIT.COMMIT.FAIL]: Failed to add file", "src/main.go")
// Output: [BREACH] ⚠️ [GIT.COMMIT.FAIL]: Failed to add file [File: src/main.go]
```

### Structured Errors with File Information
```go
err := utils.NewGitError(
    "Failed to stage file",
    originalError,
    map[string]interface{}{
        "operation": "git add",
    },
    "src/main.go",  // File context
)
// err.ProcessedFile contains "src/main.go"
```

### Error Propagation
- Errors now carry file information through the call stack
- Each layer can extract file information from wrapped errors
- Aggregated errors show all affected files

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Developers can immediately see which file caused an error
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users get specific file information in error messages
3. **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Error logs now contain file context for easier issue resolution
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing error handling continues to work
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: File context is available across all major operations

## Files Modified

1. `utils/logger.go` - Enhanced error logging function
2. `utils/errors.go` - Added file field to structured errors
3. `utils/string_utils.go` - Added helper function for testing
4. `git/git.go` - Enhanced all Git operations with file context
5. `core/commit.go` - Improved commit operations error handling
6. `core/msgs.go` - Enhanced message generation error handling
7. `core/push.go` - Improved push operations error handling
8. `tests/utils/file_error_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage

## Testing Results
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass
- ✅ New file error tests pass successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ Enhanced error messages display correctly

## Usage Examples

### Git Operations
```go
// File staging errors now show which file failed
if _, err := RunGitCmdWithTimeout(folder, envMap, 15*time.Second, "add", file); err != nil {
    utils.Error("[GIT.COMMIT.FAIL]: Failed to add file to commit: " + err.Error(), file)
    // Creates structured error with file information
}
```

### Batch Processing
```go
// Batch operations show all affected files
if len(fileErrors) > 0 {
    errorFileNames := extractFileNamesFromErrors(fileErrors)
    filesInfo := strings.Join(errorFileNames, ", ")
    utils.Error("[GIT.BATCH.FAIL]: Batch processing failed", filesInfo)
}
```

### API Calls
```go
// API errors include the files being processed
message, err := utils.SendToGemini(contextData, apiKey, commitInstructions)
if err != nil {
    filesInfo := strings.Join(filesList, ", ")
    utils.Error("[GEMINI.FAIL]: Error generating commit message", filesInfo)
}
```

This implementation successfully enhances GitCury's error reporting system while maintaining full backward compatibility and comprehensive test coverage.
